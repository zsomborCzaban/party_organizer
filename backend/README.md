# how to set up the backend

1. create a mongoDB. An easy way for this is via mongoDB Atlas (additional instructions on the mongodb website)
    - You can find the current mock data for the database in the "test_data.txt" file
2. create a maven project
    - Replace the source code and the dependecies with the ones in the repo.
    - Makes sure to create your own env file, with the database info.
